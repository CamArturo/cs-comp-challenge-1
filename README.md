# Static Comp Challenge 1

This static comp challenge is the first in a series of three challenges.

## Color 

I generated a color palette based on the red shade found in Colorado.

## Font

Lora - I choose Lora for a header font because it is a serif font and Montserrat for the text.

## Responsive

The site is responsive. There are only 2 breakpoints that are used.
